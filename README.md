How to play Face Invaders

This is a level based game that plays like the classic Space Invaders game.
Level 1 starts with 5 faces (aliens) and each subsequent level until level 6. increased the amount of aliens by 5. This means the number of aliens caps at 30
Each new level, aliens will increase in speed. Like the classic space invaders, if an alien reaches your height, you lose.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot. You can only shoot one bullet at a time, so shoot carefully!
Scoring wise, each destroyed face is worth the level value in points. This means aliens destroyed on level 1 are worth 1 point, aliens on level 2 are worth 2, etc.
