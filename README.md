Instructions:
When working on a part of the project, clone the repository and make a copy of "main.py" and rename it based on what feature will be added
Make sure to save this file in the repository that was cloned (will have the name SpaceInvadersNE111-2022)
In the .py file, make it very clear what was changed/added
In terminal, do git add <file> where <file> is the .py file
    you can use git status at any time in terminal to see which files are changed,
    green means it will be implemented on commit, red means it will not
Once ready, do git commit -m "message" where message can be replaced to leave a note of what was implemented
Do git push to finally upload to remote repository. If first time, may ask for username and password, username is github username and password is a token that will need to be generated (visit https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
Once git push goes through, whoever wants to control the main.py file can look over the new code and implement it into the main via similar process (only difference is make change to the actual main file instead of a copy). May be ideal to only have one person do this; after implentation, this person should also remove the temp feature file (what was implemented into the main code)
Reminder: Do not edit the main.py file directly otherwise
